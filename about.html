<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Trying to develop webistes! I have a vision for an ODA museum type website, it will be a Portfolio! I want to have music playing in the background and maybe distant sounds of chatter to immerse people! Ablums, just artpiece after artpiece!  </p>

<p>I want it to feature comments and a liking feature,ways for people to connect and see the vision and art TOGETHER!Also want to be able to have US be able to store our favorite pictures and have ways to share that with each other! (Of course im going to be in every comment:)</p>

<p>Love and Light To ALL!.</p>
